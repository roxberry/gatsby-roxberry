## What makes me tick?

Reading this morning's "Pointer" newsletter, see [Pointer.io](https://www.pointer.io), the first item is [The 25 Micro-habits Of High-Impact Managers](https://review.firstround.com/the-25-micro-habits-of-high-impact-managers).  One of the "micro-habits" is "Write down what makes you tick".  While I don't want to be a manager, I did like the idea of thinking about what makes me tick.  I think today (this might change day to day), but today, these 3 would rate the highest:

1. *Continuous Success* -> Clear defined requirements and achieving goals by being in a "continuous success" mode.  "Always Be Delivering".
2. *Self Managed Mindset* -> Time allocated by controlled blocks for delivery, spikes, deep dives, education, follow ups and unstructured stuff from each block.
3. *Community Actuation* -> Actuating other professionals to learn, grow, innovate and achieve their goals. Be my own community.
